<h2><%= title 'About Transbucket' %></h2>
<div class="center hero-unit">
  <p><strong>TransBucket.com</strong> was created Summer 2009 after the shutdown of <%= link_to 'Transter.com',  "http://wayback.archive.org/web/20010815000000*/http://www.transster.com" %> (2001-2009), a surgery photosharing website exclusively for FTMs. <br /><br />Rather than simply replace Transster, a new founding vision was to create a site that would be a health care and surgery resource for the <b>entire online trans* community</b>, from FTMs to MTFs to genderqueers, allies, and everyone else who could benefit from exploring the real life experiences collected here.
<br /><br />As of Fall 2012, the original founders Kit and Ryan have moved on from active management of the site. The site is now owned and developed by Alex. Alex is a trans* person, and is committed to the founding principle of an inclusive resource for the entire community.
<br /><br />You can contact us using this <%= link_to "Contact Form", contact_path %> or by email to <a href="mailto:webmaster@transbucket.com">Alex</a> about site issues. If you'd like to volunteer, please let us know. Members of currently underrepresented communities will be given priority.</p>
