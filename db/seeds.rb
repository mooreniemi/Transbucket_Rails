Her bed side manner is astounding. My dressings had to be removed on day 3 due to a pretty heavy (and very itchy...) allergic reaction to the adhesive.

Indeed a setback, but nothing that could have been prevented without prior experience or which would have been different at another surgeon. I had very little nipple sensation before surgery and have none now-- which doesn't bother me at all. I also stayed on-site above Dr. Rumer's office for an additional $500. I would certainly recommend her. Light dissatisfaction about my one nipple being a little higher than the other, but I refused to look at my naked self prior to surgery (even when she 'wrote' on me) and I think also my general problems with stitches may also have slightly aided in that issue, overall just my own visual imperfection. (I'm rarely shirtless so it's irrelevant to others.) I have had two follow-up appointments since then and smooth sailing. I would certainly recommend. All costs were out of pocket.

I was really nervous but I knew that it needed to be done!\r\nI had a simple double mastectomy with nipple grafts. I was in no pain at all when I woke up, and still haven't experienced any pain to this day.\r\nI spent only 2 nights in hospital because I had no complications and I was doing very well. The nurses were not that great, to be honest. I could tell they were very confused why I was getting the surgery, even though they knew I was transgender on my file. We had to correct them many times when they used the wrong pronouns. It was a bit annoying and they weren't enthusiastic or engaging at all.\r\nI had the drains in for only 3 days and barely any drainage fluid come out, which was great.\r\nDr Hassall is an awesome surgeon, and I am absolutely thrilled with my surgery. However, her bedside manner is quite poor and she's not very good with communicating. She managed to offend me a few times, but I let it slide. She's still pretty badass though.\r\nI received no aftercare information whatsoever besides that I had to change the tape once a week. This was pretty annoying and the staff didn't reply to our emails after the surgery was complete. Really frustrating because the nipple scabs still hadn't fallen off after 7 weeks post-op. We decided to put some vaseline on it, though, and they fell off in literally a couple days - vaseline is really great!\r\nAltogther, I am SUPER impressed with my chest and I feel absolutely amazing. I've never felt this confident in my life. It was definitely the right choice and I am so glad I chose Megan as my surgeon. Trust me, she is a terrific surgeon and her technique is really great - my scars are very thin.

A few of the things that I was worried about beforehand ended up happening, but they didn't bother me in the way I expected them to. \r\n\r\nThe main thing is sensation - I can't feel any light touches on the surface.

I can feel harder pressure if it's spread over a wider area, but in some places this causes me sensitivity or a little pain. \r\n\r\nThis is worst in my nipples, so I try to avoid touching them. However, both of them healed in a very \"erect\" position and they never go down due to scar tissue. This means that you can always see them through my shirt, and sometimes they catch on things quite painfully. It was clear from very early on in the healing process that they weren't quite right.\r\n\r\nIf I ever have the money I would like a few corrections. The scars pucker at each end and in the centre of my chest there is a little extra flesh (which doesn't feel like fat, or at least it's a different consistency) which I would like fixed. I would also seek treatment for my nipples so that they are no longer so knobbly, and I would get tattoos to fix the perimeter of the areolae, which are a bit \"splodgy\" in colour.

Three wound areas have been reduced to only two — the genital area and MLD donor site..\r\nGrafts are transferred and quilted to the ventral side of the new penis in order to allow graft acceptance and development of its own blood vessels. At the same time, the penile remnants (natal males) or clitoris (FtM transsexual) are incorporated into the neophlallus for sexual sensation. I had no complications with this stage.

I feel part of history. I decided to have my phallo surgery with Dr. Sherman Leis because I did not want to travel out of country again. I liked having a meta because blow jobs are great but realistically there is no way to have sex with a meta, it is way too small. Penetration is not possible. So I opted for a \"pubic phallo\" skin was taken from my stomach and pubic region to create my penis. The benefit of a pubic phallo is a free tummy tuck and no arm, leg,or lat scars. I did not want obvious scars to point out that I am trans. I dont get all the benefits as those other phallos but I made the right choice for me. My meta was put inside my phallo, I would probably wished to have it exposed for more sensation if possible. I do not have sexual feeling inside of my penis. I do have about 75 percent tactile feeling all over the shaft but not the glans of my penis. My meta was put inside my scrotum and when horny, my meta becomes erect inside my balls and and I get off from being rubbed, jacked off or through penetration. My orgasm comes from the slapping of my penis and balls inside and against the vagina. My meta is stimulated through sexual intercourse. I am happy with the size of my phallo but wish instead of 4 1/2 inches I would have opted for 6 1/2 inches. I also have had three penile implant surgeries. The first implant lasted 5 years, the second implant lasted two years and the third penile implant lasted one year. My body keeps rejecting the implants and over time the implant moves around in the phallo and can pop out. I have suffered from MRSA and staph infections from penile implants. I may consider getting one again down the road, but I am tired of being hospitalized and losing implants. So how do I penetrate, I use what is called a penis sleeve, or penis extender and I have attached photos. It works great for penetration but I am unable to feel the inside of my GF vagina when wearing one, her vaginal skin and the shaft of my penis is covered with the penis sleeve. Yet, we both are able to orgasm so there is no big complaints but I would like to feel her. I am looking forward to possible implant in the future, but for right now the sleeve works great, there are many sizes, colors,lengths and styles available online. Overall, I am happy with my phallo. I would like to have my glans shaped more defined and implant in future.</p>", cost: 20000, username: nil, state: "published", sensation: 2, satisfaction: 3},
